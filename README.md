This is the project I did with Amazon


Amazon  â€“  Inbound Transportation Optimization tool

Given orders, locations, constraints (temperature, operational, time, capacity, truck), output the optimal route & schedule that minimizes total cost

To use, run the first two cells. Then, go to the cell with the temperature_filter and week_filter set to a certain option and run all below after setting the filters.
